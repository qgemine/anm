ANM Benchmark
===

In order to promote the development of computational techniques for **Active Network Management (ANM)**, we propose a test instance of a generic ANM problem. It can be used as a test bed for comparing existing computational techniques, as well as for developing new ones.

Problem formulation
---

The generic formulation of the ANM problem is motivated and described in [this paper](http://arxiv.org/pdf/1405.2806.pdf), which details also the procedure used for building the test instance.

Installation
---

This code runs on Matlab and requires the Statistics and Optimization toolboxes as well as the third-party [YALMIP toolbox](http://users.isy.liu.se/johanl/yalmip/) (free and easy to install).
